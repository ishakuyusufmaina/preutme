        An animal cell is the basic structural and functional unit of animals. It is eukaryotic, meaning it has a true nucleus enclosed by a membrane and various specialized organelles that perform specific tasks. Animal cells are typically round or irregular in shape and are surrounded by a flexible <strong>cell membrane</strong> that controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell.

    <h3>Key Parts of an Animal Cell:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nucleus:</strong> Contains genetic material (DNA) and controls cell activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Cytoplasm:</strong> A jelly-like substance where chemical reactions occur and organelles are suspended.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitochondria:</strong> Known as the "powerhouse" of the cell, they produce energy through cellular respiration.</li>
        <li><strong>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):</strong> Involved in protein and lipid synthesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Golgi Apparatus:</strong> Packages and transports proteins and other materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Lysosomes:</strong> Contain digestive enzymes to break down waste and cellular debris.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Animal cells differ from plant cells because they lack a cell wall and chloroplasts but are highly specialized to perform various functions in multicellular organisms.
