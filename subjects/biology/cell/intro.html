  Cell is the basic unit of life.
</p>
<p>
  Every living thing, <strong>plant</strong> 
  or <strong>animal</strong> is made up of
  cell. Hence, we have animal cell and plant cell. 
</p>
<p>
  Cells are living things. 
  And so, cells do respiration,
  do eating or feeding,
  do give birth to new cell 
  or reproduction,
  just like other living things, with 
  the use of structures called
  <strong>organelles.</strong>
  Repeat after me, <strong>organelles!</strong>
